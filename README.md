# Delay-Tolerant-Networks
You can find my Engineer's Diploma thesis "Experimental Evaluation of distributed algorithms for mobile ad-hoc Delay Tolerant Networks" (Greek), 
the code I created for a new movement model for the ONE simulator, 
as well as some perl scripts used to make data from crawdad in the right format for ONE.
